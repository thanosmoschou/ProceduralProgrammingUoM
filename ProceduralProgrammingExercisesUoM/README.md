These are my exercises from the procedural programming courses I attended at the first semester of my undergraduate studies at UoM. I also have the C assignments sheets that explain every program and its functionality. Every program has the following naming patern.
For example: a5f9 which means exercise 5 from the 9th C assignment paper.
The IDLE that we used was CodeBlocks.
